# wasmrs-frames

This crate provides the encoding, decoding, and data structures for wasmRS RSocket frames.

## More Information

For more information on wasmRS, see the core [wasmrs](https://github.com/nanobus/iota/blob/main/rust/crates/wasmrs/README.md) crate.

WasmRS makes heavy use of generated code from `apex` specs and generators to automate all of the boilerplate. See the [getting-started](https://github.com/nanobus/nanobus/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) for nanobus for up-to-date usage.
